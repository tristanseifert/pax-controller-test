# Pax Controller Test
This repo contains a very simple Swift based application that exists as basically a thin wrapper around [CoreBluetooth](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth) calls. There are some reusable classes for communicating with the devices as well as some documentation on the protocol in this repository.

See [this blog post](http://blraaz.me/reverse-engineering/2021/08/29/bluetooth-reverse-engineering.html) for some more information about this project; additional information and notes are [available here.](https://bookstack.trist.network/books/reverse-engineering/chapter/pax)
